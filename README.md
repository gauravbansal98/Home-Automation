# Home-Automation
Home automation system built using Arduino Uno, ESP8266 and many sensors. The home can be controlled using mobile, laptop, remote etc.
This contains code for the arduino, esp8266 and processing software.
I lost my code for arduino but I am uploading a similar code which can be used after doing some changes.
